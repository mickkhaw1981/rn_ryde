# Stripe Payment Integration Implementation Plan

After analyzing the current codebase and Stripe payment integration requirements, I've developed a comprehensive implementation plan to enable users to pay for rides using Stripe.

## Flow Diagram

![Payment Flow Diagram](./payment-flow-diagram.mermaid)

## Overall Architecture

We'll create a flow that:

1. Initializes Stripe in the Payment component
2. Creates a payment intent via a server endpoint
3. Shows the Stripe payment sheet
4. Processes the payment
5. Creates a ride record on successful payment
6. Shows appropriate feedback to the user

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. API Endpoints

#### 1.1. Create Payment Intent Endpoint

**File:** `/app/(api)/payment+api.ts`

This endpoint will:

- Accept POST requests
- Inputs (see request structure)
- Outputs (see response structure). This response isn't stored in a database - it's sent back to the client to initialize the payment sheet.

Logic flow:

- First, it checks if all required fields are present
- It then tries to find an existing Stripe customer with the provided email from Clerk. If not, create a new Stripe customer (in Stripe's table). If already exists, use that customer. Use ClerkId to get user's email to perform the check
- Create an ephemeral key for the customer
- Create a payment intent with
  - The amount (multiplied by 100 to convert to cents)
  - Currency (USD)
  - Customer ID
  - Automatic payment methods enabled
- Return client secrets to initialize the payment sheet

```typescript
// Expected request structure:
{
  amount: number,       // Amount in smallest currency unit (cents)
  currency: string,     // Currency code (e.g., 'usd')
  customer_email: string // Optional, for customer creation
}

// Expected response structure:
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: {
    paymentIntent: string,    // Client secret for the payment intent
    ephemeralKey: string,     // Ephemeral key secret
    customer: string,         // Customer ID
  },
  error?: string
}
```

#### 1.2. Create Ride Record Endpoint

**File:** `/app/(api)/ride+api.ts`

This endpoint will:

- Accept POST requests
- Inputs (see request structure)
- Outputs (see response structure)
- Use web-platform Response and Request APIs. DO NOT use NextReponse

Logic:

- It validates that all required fields are present in the request body
- If any required field is missing, it returns a 400 error
- It connects to the Neon database (see helper /lib/db.ts). DO NOT create a new database as I've already created the Rides table in Neon. Please check though.
- It inserts a new record into the rides table with all the provided information
- It returns the newly created ride data
- Set payment status to "paid"

```typescript
// Expected request structure (based on Ride type):
{
  origin_address: string,
  destination_address: string,
  origin_latitude: number,
  origin_longitude: number,
  destination_latitude: number,
  destination_longitude: number,
  ride_time: number,
  fare_price: number,
  payment_status: string,  // Will be "paid"
  driver_id: number,
  user_email: string
}

// Expected response structure:
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: Ride,       // Created ride record
  error?: string
}
```

### 2. Component Updates

#### 2.1. Update Payment Component

**File:** `components/Payment.tsx`

We'll modify this component to:

1. Initialize Stripe provider
2. Fetch payment intent from server
3. Initialize and present payment sheet
4. Handle payment result and trigger ride creation
5. Modify the button title from "Pay Now" to "Pay ${amount}"

```typescript
// New props to receive from book-ride.tsx:
interface PaymentProps {
  amount: number; // Price from selected driver
  driverId: number; // ID of selected driver
  userEmail: string; // Email of current user
  originAddress: string; // User's pickup location
  destinationAddress: string; // User's destination
  originLatitude: number; // User's pickup latitude
  originLongitude: number; // User's pickup longitude
  destinationLatitude: number; // User's destination latitude
  destinationLongitude: number; // User's destination longitude
  rideTime: number; // Estimated ride time
}
```

## 2.2. Update BookRide Component - Detailed Props Breakdown

**File:** `app/(root)/book-ride.tsx`

The BookRide component needs to pass these specific props to the Payment component:

1. **amount**:

   - Source: `driverDetails?.price`
   - Transformation: Convert from string with dollar sign (e.g., "$15.00") to number in cents (1500)
   - Example: `amount={parseFloat(driverDetails?.price.replace('$', '')) * 100}`

2. **driverId**:

   - Source: `selectedDriver`
   - No transformation needed
   - Example: `driverId={selectedDriver}`

3. **userEmail**:

   - Source: `user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress`
   - Example: `userEmail={user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress || ''}`

4. **originAddress**:

   - Source: `userAddress` from LocationStore
   - Example: `originAddress={userAddress || ''}`

5. **destinationAddress**:

   - Source: `destinationAddress` from LocationStore
   - Example: `destinationAddress={destinationAddress || ''}`

6. **originLatitude/originLongitude**:

   - Source: `userLatitude`, `userLongitude` from LocationStore
   - Need to also import these from the store
   - Example: `originLatitude={userLatitude || 0} originLongitude={userLongitude || 0}`

7. **destinationLatitude/destinationLongitude**:

   - Source: `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude` from LocationStore
   - Already imported in the component
   - Example: `destinationLatitude={destinationLatitude || 0} destinationLongitude={destinationLongitude || 0}`

8. **rideTime**:
   - Source: `driverDetails?.time`
   - Example: `rideTime={driverDetails?.time || 0}`

The complete component update will look like:

```tsx
// In BookRide.tsx
// Additional imports needed:
import { useUser } from "@clerk/clerk-expo";
import { useLocationStore, useDriverStore } from "@/store";

const BookRide = () => {
  const { user } = useUser();
  const { userAddress, destinationAddress, userLatitude, userLongitude, destinationLatitude, destinationLongitude } = useLocationStore();
  const { drivers, selectedDriver } = useDriverStore();

  const driverDetails = drivers?.filter(
    (driver) => +driver.id === selectedDriver
  )[0];

  // Rest of the component...

  return (
    // Rest of the JSX...

    <Payment
      amount={parseFloat(driverDetails?.price?.replace('$', '') || '0') * 100}
      title=`Pay ${amount}`
      driverId={selectedDriver || 0}
      userEmail={user?.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress || ''}
      originAddress={userAddress || ''}
      destinationAddress={destinationAddress || ''}
      originLatitude={userLatitude || 0}
      originLongitude={userLongitude || 0}
      destinationLatitude={destinationLatitude || 0}
      destinationLongitude={destinationLongitude || 0}
      rideTime={driverDetails?.time || 0}
    />
  );
};
```

Then in the Payment component, we'll need to accept these props and use them for the payment flow and ride creation. The Payment component will:

1. Use the `amount` prop to determine how much to charge and to update the button title
2. Use the location and driver props to create the ride record after payment
3. Use the user email for customer creation in Stripe

This way, all the necessary data flows from BookRide to Payment, enabling a complete payment and ride creation flow.

### 3. Implementation Details

#### 3.1. Initialize Stripe Provider

Initialize the Stripe provider in the Payment component using the environment variable:

```typescript
// Payment.tsx
const publishableKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY || "";
```

#### 3.2. Payment Flow Implementation

1. Fetch payment sheet parameters from the server
2. Initialize the payment sheet
3. Present the payment sheet when "Pay Now" is clicked
4. Handle payment result
5. Create ride record on successful payment

#### 3.3. Error Handling

Implement error handling for:

1. Failed payment intent creation
2. Failed payment sheet initialization
3. Failed payment processing
4. Failed ride creation

### 4. User Feedback

1. Show loading states while payment is processing
2. Show success/error messages after payment
3. Provide appropriate navigation options after payment

## Milestone Checkpoints

### Milestone 1: Payment Sheet Appears

- Stripe provider is initialized
- Payment sheet is configured and appears when "Pay Now" is clicked
- Verification: User can see the Stripe payment form

### Milestone 2: Payment Confirmation and Ride Creation

- Payment is processed successfully
- Ride is created in the database
- User sees confirmation modal
- Console log shows payment status and ride creation status
- Verification: Check console logs and database entry

## Specific File Changes

Let's detail the specific changes needed for each file:

### 1. `/app/(api)/payment+api.ts` (Create New File)

- Create a new file for handling payment intent creation
- Implement the POST handler for creating payment intents
- Set up Stripe integration using secret key
- Return necessary data for client-side payment sheet

### 2. `/app/(api)/ride+api.ts` (Create New File)

- Create a new file for handling ride record creation
- Implement the POST handler for saving ride details
- Connect to the database and insert ride data
- Return created ride or error information

### 3. `components/Payment.tsx` (Modify)

- Import Stripe hooks and components
- Set up Stripe provider
- Implement payment flow functions:
  - `fetchPaymentSheetParams()`
  - `initializePaymentSheet()`
  - `openPaymentSheet()`
- Add handling for payment results
- Implement ride creation after successful payment
- Add loading states and user feedback

### 4. `app/(root)/book-ride.tsx` (Modify)

- Update to pass all necessary props to the Payment component
- Include user details, ride details, and payment amount

## Detailed Implementation Steps

Let's break this down into specific implementation steps:

### Step 1: Create Payment API Endpoint

**File:** `/app/(api)/payment+api.ts`

This API will:

1. Use the Stripe server SDK
2. Create a customer if needed
3. Create an ephemeral key
4. Create a payment intent
5. Return the necessary secrets to the client

### Step 2: Create Ride API Endpoint

**File:** `/app/(api)/ride+api.ts`

This API will:

1. Validate the incoming ride data
2. Connect to the database
3. Insert the ride record with payment status "paid"
4. Return the created ride or error information

### Step 3: Update Payment Component

**File:** `components/Payment.tsx`

The updated component will:

1. Wrap content in StripeProvider
2. Implement the payment flow
3. Handle payment result
4. Create ride record on successful payment
5. Show appropriate feedback

### Step 4: Update BookRide Component

**File:** `app/(root)/book-ride.tsx`

The updated component will pass all necessary props to Payment.

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for integrating Stripe payments into the app, following the best practices outlined in the Stripe documentation.
