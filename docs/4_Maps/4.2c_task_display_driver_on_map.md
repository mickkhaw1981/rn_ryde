# Driver Locations on Map Implementation Checklist

## 1. Create Dummy Driver Data

- [x] Create `/dummy_data/mock_drivers.ts` file
- [x] Define a constant array of 4 driver objects following the `Driver` interface
- [x] Include all required fields for each driver: driver_id, first_name, last_name, profile_image_url, car_image_url, car_seats, and rating
- [x] Use realistic data with appropriate names, image URLs, and ratings (between 3.0 and 5.0)
- [x] Add proper TypeScript typing for the mock data
- [x] Export the mock drivers array as default export
- [x] Add comments explaining the purpose of this mock data file

## 2. Create Driver Location Store with Zustand

- [x] Update `/store/index.ts` to import the `DriverStore` interface from types
- [x] Import mock drivers data from the newly created file
- [x] Create a `generateDriversNearLocation` helper function that:
  - [x] Takes user latitude and longitude as parameters
  - [x] Creates random offsets between 0.001 and 0.005 for each driver
  - [x] Ensures drivers are positioned uniquely (not on top of each other)
  - [x] Converts driver data to `MarkerData` format with calculated locations
  - [x] Returns an array of `MarkerData` objects
- [x] Implement a new Zustand store called `useDriverStore`
- [x] Initialize store with empty drivers array and null selectedDriver
- [x] Add `setDrivers` method to update drivers array
- [x] Add `setSelectedDriver` method to update selected driver ID
- [x] Add `clearSelectedDriver` method to set selectedDriver to null
- [x] Export the driver store

## 3. Update Map Generation Helper

- [x] Modify `/lib/map.ts`
- [x] Update the `generateMarkersFromData` function signature to accept an optional `drivers` parameter of type `MarkerData[]`
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing calls
- [x] Add logic to process driver markers if `drivers` parameter is provided
- [x] For each driver, create a marker object with:
  - [x] id derived from driver_id
  - [x] coordinates from driver location
  - [x] title using first_name and last_name
  - [x] description with rating information
  - [x] Additional driver-specific properties
- [x] Add driver markers to the returned markers array
- [x] Update any JSDoc comments to reflect the changes

## 4. Update Map Component

- [x] Modify `/components/Map.tsx`
- [x] Import the driver store (`useDriverStore`)
- [x] Import marker image from constants (`icons.marker`)
- [x] Add state to track the generated driver markers
- [x] Create a useEffect hook that:
  - [x] Triggers when user location changes
  - [x] Calls `generateDriversNearLocation` with user coordinates
  - [x] Updates driver store with new driver locations
  - [x] Has the proper dependency array
- [x] Update marker generation code to include driver markers
- [x] Modify the Marker component rendering to:
  - [x] Use image prop for driver markers
  - [x] Set the marker.png as the image for driver markers
  - [x] Apply appropriate styling for marker images
  - [x] Handle different rendering for user vs. driver markers
- [x] Add a check to prevent rendering when no coordinates are available

## 5. Implement Integration Logic

- [x] Ensure driver locations update when user location changes
- [x] Verify proper data flow between user location, driver store, and map component
- [x] Implement conditional logic to prevent unnecessary regeneration of driver locations
- [x] Add proper error handling for cases when user location is null
- [x] Ensure map view updates appropriately when drivers are added

## 6. Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Test driver marker appearance on map
- [ ] Verify markers update when user location changes
- [ ] Check that driver markers appear within visible map region
- [ ] Ensure driver markers don't overlap each other
- [ ] Validate that driver information is correctly displayed
- [ ] Test edge cases (no user location, extreme coordinates, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## 7. Documentation

- [x] Add comments to explain the driver location generation algorithm
- [x] Document the flow of data from store to map component
- [x] Add appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces where needed
- [ ] Update any relevant README or documentation files
