# Implementation Plan for Displaying Drivers on Map

## 1. Create Dummy Driver Data

**File to create**: `/dummy_data/mock_drivers.ts`

- Create data for 4 drivers following the `Driver` interface from `types/type.d.ts`
- Include all required fields: driver_id, first_name, last_name, profile_image_url, car_image_url, car_seats, and rating
- Use realistic data to make the UI look professional

## 2. Create Driver Location Store with Zustand

**File to modify**: `/store/index.ts`

- Add a new Zustand store called `useDriverStore` that implements the `DriverStore` interface
- Implement functions to:
  - Store driver locations as an array of `MarkerData` objects
  - Set and clear a selected driver
  - Calculate random offsets for each driver based on the user's location
- Add a function `generateDriversNearLocation` that takes user coordinates and creates driver locations with small random offsets (0.001-0.005 range for latitude/longitude)

## 3. Update Map Generation Helper

**File to modify**: `/lib/map.ts`

- Extend the `generateMarkersFromData` function to handle driver markers:
  - Add a new parameter for drivers array of type `MarkerData[]`
  - Update return type to include driver markers with proper formatting
  - Ensure the function maintains backward compatibility

## 4. Update Map Component

**File to modify**: `/components/Map.tsx`

- Import the driver store and marker image from constants
- Add a useEffect hook to:
  - Generate driver locations when user location changes
  - Use the extended marker generation function to create markers for both user location and drivers
- Update the Marker component to use the marker.png image for driver markers
- Add logic to differentiate between user markers and driver markers

## 5. Integration Points

1. **Driver Location Generation**:

   - Trigger when user location is set
   - Use random offsets to make drivers appear near the user
   - Store the driver data in the Zustand store

2. **Marker Rendering**:
   - Consume driver data from store in Map component
   - Render custom markers with the marker.png image
   - Display different marker styles for user vs drivers

## 6. Data Structure Changes

### Extended MarkerData Interface Usage:

- Ensure all required fields for drivers are populated
- When generating markers from driver data, map the driver properties to marker properties

### Driver Store State:

- `drivers`: Array of MarkerData objects
- `selectedDriver`: ID of the currently selected driver (or null)
- Functions to manipulate this state

## 7. Implementation Decisions

1. **Driver Location Algorithm**:

   - Use small random offsets (0.001-0.005 degrees) from the user's location
   - Ensure drivers appear within visible map bounds
   - Avoid placing drivers too close to each other

2. **Marker Customization**:

   - Use marker.png from assets for driver markers
   - Consider size and appearance differences between user and driver markers

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Only update driver locations when user location changes significantly
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using proper dependency arrays in useEffect

## 8. Implementation Steps Sequence

1. Create dummy driver data in `/dummy_data/mock_drivers.ts`
2. Implement driver store in `/store/index.ts`
3. Update marker generation helper in `/lib/map.ts`
4. Modify Map component to use the driver store and display markers
5. Test and refine the implementation

You are a senior software engineer whose role is to provide clear, actionable code changes. Based on the implementation plan above, create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. Insert it in .cursor-tasks.md. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task.
