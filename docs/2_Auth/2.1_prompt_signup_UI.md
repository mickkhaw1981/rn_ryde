We are working in design mode. I want you to only work on the front end. You won't be connecting to the database at this point.

Our task is to create the UI for @sign-up.tsx. We must exactly matching the design provided here We must exactly matching the design provided here @https://www.figma.com/design/mFAMADQwfM5Xwe7jsN6KyA/Ryde---Uber-Clone-App-(Copy)?node-id=67003-8417&t=6JCWahBluImBvHhf-4

This is a breakdown of the Sign Up page and its main components.

1/ Page layout (top to bottom)

- A background image of a car with a fade effect (using the signup-car.png image that's available in the assets/images folder and referenced in constants/index.ts)
- Heading text "Create Your Account" in large, bold font
- Three form fields arranged vertically:
  - Name field with a profile icon, label "Name", and placeholder "Enter name"
  - Email field with an email icon, label "Email", with sample text "adrian@jsmastery.pr"
  - Password field with a lock icon, label "Password", placeholder "Enter password", and an eye-off icon to toggle password visibility
- A blue "Sign Up" button with white text and a subtle shadow effect
- An "Or" divider with horizontal lines on either side
- A "Log In with Google" button with the Google logo (colorful G icon) and grey border
- Text at the bottom saying "Already have an account? Log in" with "Log in" in grey and the rest in darker text. This sends the user to the sign-in page

2/ Implmentation details

- Wrap entire screen in ScrollView component
- Use the PrimaryButton.tsx component for the Sign Up button
- Define the onSignUpPress funcion for on Press
- Use PrimaryButton.tsx for the "Log In with Google" button, passing in the appropriate props (e.g. bgVariant="outline" and textVariant="primary"). The Google logo can be found in assets/icons folder as google.png. Make sure the rounded corners are similar to PrimaryButton.tsx
- Define the handleGoogleSign funcion for the onPress (leave empty for now)
- Use the Divider.tsx component for the divider
- Use the Eye and EyeOff component from lucide-react-native (already installed) to toggle password visibility
- Modify the existing FormField.tsx to re-use for the Name, Email and Password fields respectively. It should have props like label, placeholder, icon, value, onChangeText, labelStyle, containerStyle, iconStyle, className, secureTextEntry.
- For the icons in the form field, use User, Email and Lock icons from lucide-react-native (already installed)
